GRADIEND (Gradient-based targeted feature learning within neural networks) learns features inside language models by training an encoder-decoder on gradients. Find where a model encodes a feature (e.g. gender, race) and rewrite the model to strengthen or weaken it—for example debias it—while keeping other behaviour. See [GRADIEND: Feature Learning within Neural Networks Exemplified through Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01406) (introducing the GRADIEND method), and [The GRADIEND Python Package: An End-to-End System for Gradient-Based Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23993) (introducing this Python library).

![GRADIEND overview](docs/img/workflow-diagram.png)


## Installation

With minimal requirements:
```bash
pip install gradiend
```

With recommended dependencies (enables additional features such as Hugging Face `device_map` loading, datasets, safetensors, and plotting):

```bash
pip install gradiend[recommended]
```

Similarly, `gradiend[data]` and `gradiend[plot]` install only the optional data-generation and plotting dependencies, respectively.

Installation from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aieng-lab/gradiend.git
cd gradiend
pip install -e ".[recommended]"
```

## Quick start

Self-contained example (see more text for meaningful training below or in the [example file](gradiend/examples/readme.py); requires `gradiend[plot]` for plotting):

```python
from gradiend import TextPredictionDataCreator, TextFilterConfig, TrainingArguments, TextPredictionTrainer

base = [
    "The chef tasted the soup, then he added pepper.",
    "The players ran; they scored.",
    "She handed the package to the courier and asked them to deliver it.",
    # ... see more texts in the dropdown below (needed to run a meaningful training)
]
creator = TextPredictionDataCreator(
    base_data=base,
    feature_targets=[
        TextFilterConfig(targets=["he", "she", "it"], id="3SG"),
        TextFilterConfig(target="they", id="3PL"),
    ],
)
training = creator.generate_training_data(max_size_per_class=30)
neutral = creator.generate_neutral_data(additional_excluded_words=["i", "we", "you"], max_size=10)

args = TrainingArguments(
    train_batch_size=2,
    eval_steps=5,
    max_steps=20,
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    fail_on_non_convergence=True,
)
trainer = TextPredictionTrainer(model="bert-base-cased", data=training, eval_neutral_data=neutral, args=args)
trainer.train()
trainer.plot_training_convergence()

enc_result = trainer.evaluate_encoder(plot=True)
dec = trainer.evaluate_decoder(plot=True, target_class="3SG")
changed_model = trainer.rewrite_base_model(decoder_results=dec, target_class="3SG")
```

## Temporary and saved interventions

Use `intervene()` for scoped causal probes without leaving global model state behind:

```python
with model_with_gradiend.intervene(value=0.5, signal="auto", part="decoder") as intervention:
    outputs = model_with_gradiend(**inputs)
    print(intervention["signal"], intervention["num_dimensions"])
```

`value=0` is a no-op. Gradient-space GRADIEND interventions temporarily apply
and then roll back a weight delta; activation-space ACTIEND interventions
temporarily install and remove activation hooks.

For ACTIEND, `evaluate_decoder(target_class=...)` uses a directional encoder
selector: it applies the decoded activation delta at the trained activation site
only for tokens whose ACTIEND encoding points toward the selected target-class
direction. For concept/topic steering during generation, use an unconditional
runtime selector such as `token_selector="all"`.
For ablations, keep the two axes separate: `token_selector` chooses where
steering is allowed, while `activation_gate` optionally adds an ACTIEND
encoder-fired condition, for example
`token_selector="prediction", activation_gate="encoder_direction"`.
Use `activation_modules="transformer.h.9"` to restrict a hooked ACTIEND model
to one trained activation site for layer/site ablations.

When debugging ACTIEND selectors, measure operational coverage separately from
encoder AUC/correlation: `activation_selector_coverage(...)` reports how often
the same selector mask used by hooks would fire on a batch. Low neutral coverage
is a specificity sanity check; the causal choice should still be judged by
decoder probability shift under the LMS gate.

Use `modify_model()` for a chosen intervention you want to keep:

```python
modified = trainer.modify_model(decoder_results=decoder_stats, target_class="3SG")
modified.save_pretrained_modified("./modified-actiend")

from gradiend import load_modified_model
reloaded = load_modified_model("./modified-actiend")
```

Passing `output_dir` to `trainer.modify_model(...)` saves directly and returns
the saved path.
