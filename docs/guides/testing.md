# Testing and coverage

## Unit tests (fast)

Run the test suite in `tests/` (excludes slow and integration tests by default in CI):

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=long
```

**Examples-are-running (smoke) tests:** Check that all `gradiend.examples` scripts run to completion (no metric checks). Run from the **project root** (examples are in the [repository](https://github.com/aieng-lab/gradiend/tree/main/gradiend/examples), not in the pip package):

```bash
pytest test_bench/examples/ -v -s
```

These tests are marked `slow` and `integration`; they run each example as a subprocess and assert exit code 0. On failure, full logs are written to `test_bench/results/last_failure_<module>.log`. See [test_bench/README.md](../../test_bench/README.md) for smoke-only options (e.g. `-m integration`) and details.

For an offline GPU job, first prepare every dataset, model, spaCy package, and
the complete raw Wikipedia dataset snapshot using the same shared cache as the job:

```bash
python scripts/prefetch_example_assets.py --cache-dir /shared/drechsel/hf-cache
python scripts/prefetch_example_assets.py --cache-dir /shared/drechsel/hf-cache --verify-only
```

Set `HF_HOME=/shared/drechsel/hf-cache` in the offline test job as well. The
explicit path prevents models from being prefetched into a login node's default
`~/.cache/huggingface` while the job reads the shared cache.

`scripts/prefetch_hf_datasets.py` is only the legacy dataset/export helper; it
does not fetch models such as `dbmdz/german-gpt2` and is not sufficient for the
offline example suite.

The main test suite exposes the same smoke runner through `tests/test_examples_smoke_integration.py`. Therefore the complete heavyweight selection includes both the slow/integration tests and all configured example runs:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v -s -m "slow or integration"
```

Do not run this command as a routine unit-test check: it loads real models and executes training examples. The bridge delegates to the test-bench implementation, so the example list and failure logging remain defined in one place.

Exclude slow/integration tests explicitly:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v -m "not slow and not integration"
```

Run a single test file or test:

```bash
pytest tests/test_data_generation.py -v
pytest tests/test_img_format.py::TestImgFormatTrainerForwarding::test_plot_encoder_distributions_receives_img_format_from_trainer -v
```

## Test coverage

Install dev dependencies (includes `pytest-cov`):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
# or: pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run tests with coverage report (terminal + optional HTML):

```bash
# Coverage for package code only (exclude tests and examples)
pytest tests/ -v --cov=gradiend --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html -m "not slow and not integration"
```

- **Terminal:** `--cov-report=term-missing` shows missed lines per file.
- **HTML report:** `--cov-report=html` writes `htmlcov/index.html`; open it in a browser to see line-by-line coverage and find untested code.

Useful options:

- `--cov-fail-under=60` — fail the run if total coverage is below 60%.
- Omit `-m "not slow and not integration"` to include all tests (slower).

## Test bench (integration, GPU)

The **test bench** runs real training and verification; it is slower and typically needs a GPU. **You do not need reference scores:** verified tests use built-in thresholds (e.g. correlation ≥ 0.35); run the bench the same way every time. See [test_bench/README.md](https://github.com/aieng-lab/gradiend/blob/main/test_bench/README.md) for first-time run and:

- **Running locally:** `python test_bench/run_bench.py`
- **Docker (recommended):** Build and run the test-bench image; it runs the full test bench including **verified runs** that assert scores (e.g. correlation ≥ threshold) and required files. Use `--build-arg BASE_IMAGE=continuumio/miniconda3:py311` for a different Python.
- **Unit tests in Docker (no GPU):** `docker build -f test_bench/Dockerfile.unit-tests --build-arg PYTHON_VERSION=3.11 -t gradiend-unit-tests .` then `docker run --rm gradiend-unit-tests`.

The test bench is **not** run in standard CI; run it manually or in a nightly job.
