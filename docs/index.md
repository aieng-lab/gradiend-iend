## What is GRADIEND?

GRADIEND is a method for **learning features within neural networks** by training an encoder-decoder architecture on model gradients. With this library you can **find where a language model encodes a feature** (e.g. gender, race, religion) and **rewrite the model** to strengthen or weaken it—for example debias it—while keeping other behaviour.

![GRADIEND overview](img/workflow-diagram.png)

GRADIEND works by:
1. **Training an encoder-decoder network** on gradients computed from masked text predictions
2. **Learning a single latent feature neuron** that encodes the desired interpretation (e.g., gender bias)
3. **Using the decoder** to modify the base model's weights, enabling targeted feature manipulation

The method is described in detail in the paper: **[GRADIEND: Feature Learning within Neural Networks Exemplified through Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01406)** (ICLR 2026, Drechsel & Herbold, 2025).

> While GRADIEND is methodologically defined to work with any *gradient-learned* and *weight-based* model, this library currently documents and supports **text prediction** as the primary workflow. Preliminary TextClassification code exists, but it is experimental in this release and not recommended as the starting point for new users.
