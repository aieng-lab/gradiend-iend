# Train Your first GRADIEND model: A step-by-step workflow

This page walks through a **self-contained** workflow: you train and evaluate a GRADIEND model for singular-plural feature based on English third person pronouns.

## 1. Create data with [`TextPredictionDataCreator`][gradiend.data.text.prediction.creator.TextPredictionDataCreator]

To extract the desired feature *singular-plural*, we extract data where feature-related tokens are masked. We use third-person pronouns in English for that, i.e., *he*/*she*/*it* (3SG) and *they* (3PL). We need some base data to filter from and extract masks (e.g., *he* gets replaced by *[MASK]*); for the sake of this simple example, we use an explicit list of texts (75+ in the runnable script; a short excerpt is shown below):

```python
ARTIFICIAL_TEXTS = [
    "The chef tasted the soup, then he added a pinch of pepper and stirred it.",
    "The pianist closed her eyes and played the final chord; she had practised it for weeks.",
    "The dog ran to the door; it wanted to go outside and chase the ball.",
    # ...
]
```

[:material-file-code-outline: `start_workflow.py`](https://github.com/aieng-lab/gradiend/blob/main/gradiend/examples/start_workflow.py)

We need to mask the pronouns in the texts, e.g., "The chef tasted the soup, then [MASK] added ..." , with the *factual* label being "he" based on the original text. For GRADIEND, we later automatically consider also the *counterfactual/alternative* target *they* by the chosen feature. Symmetrical, we derive texts with factual *they* and counterfactual *he*/*she*/*it*.

!!! tip "You want to run this tutorial? Copy the full list"
    The tutorial shows only three texts. For a working run you need enough 3SG/3PL sentences. Expand below to see enough texts for a successful training run — use the copy button on the code block to paste them into your script.

    ]
    ```

This package provides an easy way to derive such masked texts using [`TextPredictionDataCreator`][gradiend.data.text.prediction.creator.TextPredictionDataCreator]. This basic example uses basic string matching based on [`TextFilterConfig`][gradiend.data.text.filter_config.TextFilterConfig] (see [here](guides/data-handling.md) for advanced filtering based on [spacy](https://spacy.io/)).

```python
from gradiend import TextPredictionDataCreator, TextFilterConfig
creator = TextPredictionDataCreator(
    base_data=ARTIFICIAL_TEXTS,
    feature_targets=[
        TextFilterConfig(targets=["he", "she", "it"], id="3SG"),
        TextFilterConfig(targets=["they"], id="3PL"),
    ],
)
training = creator.generate_training_data(max_size_per_class=10)
```

This creates training data for GRADIEND, automatically split into train/validation/test splits.

To evaluate GRADIEND models, a dataset independent (*neutral*) of the considered feature is useful for feature-independent evaluation (e.g., to compute a language modeling score). This is optional but recommended; [`TextPredictionDataCreator`][gradiend.data.text.prediction.creator.TextPredictionDataCreator] supports it. When omitted, decoder evaluation falls back to training-like data (see [FAQ](faq.md#is-neutral-data-eval_neutral_data-required)). 

```python
NEUTRAL_EXCLUDE = ["i", "we", "you", "he", "she", "it", "they", "me", "us", "him", "her", "them"]
neutral = creator.generate_neutral_data(additional_excluded_words=NEUTRAL_EXCLUDE, max_size=15)
```

## 2. Train a GRADIEND model

With the generated data, we can simply train and evaluate a GRADIEND model encoding the targeted feature (*singular-plural*), by using [`TextPredictionTrainer`][gradiend.trainer.text.prediction.trainer.TextPredictionTrainer].

```python
from gradiend import TrainingArguments, TextPredictionTrainer

# use minimal training settings
args = TrainingArguments(
    train_batch_size=4,
    eval_steps=5,
    max_steps=25,
    learning_rate=1e-3,
    fail_on_non_convergence=True,
)
trainer = TextPredictionTrainer(
    model="bert-base-uncased", 
    data=training,
    eval_neutral_data=neutral, 
    args=args)
trainer.train()
```

Based on our used toy training configuration, we just train for 25 steps, considering 4 texts of equal feature class (3SG or 3PL), and evaluate every 5 steps. The training stats can be plotted by using [`trainer.plot_training_convergence()`][gradiend.trainer.trainer.Trainer.plot_training_convergence]. The plot shows training loss and encoder correlation over steps.

> **Having memory issues?** (e.g. CUDA out of memory errors) — Reduce GPU memory usage with pre-pruning. See the [Pruning guide](guides/pruning-guide.md), [Training tutorial — Pruning](tutorials/training.md#pruning), and [FAQ](faq.md#i-get-a-cuda-out-of-memory-error-how-can-i-reduce-memory-usage) for details.

The evaluation results during training can be visualized via [`trainer.plot_training_convergence()`][gradiend.trainer.trainer.Trainer.plot_training_convergence], which shows the training loss and encoder correlation over steps. The correlation is computed between the encoded gradients and the feature classes (3SG vs 3PL) on the evaluation set, and is expected to increase during training.

-->

## 3. Evaluate the GRADIEND model

The evaluation of a GRADIEND model consists of two core steps: GRADIEND encoder (to which values are different gradients encoded?) and decoder (can we change the base model's behavior related to the feature?) analysis.

The encoder evaluation uses training data on test split and neutral data, and can be run and plotted using:
```python
enc_result = trainer.evaluate_encoder(plot=True)
print("Correlation:", enc_result.get("correlation"))
```

<!-- DOC_PLOT: docs/img/start_workflow_encoder_analysis_split_test.png
Regenerate: gradiend/examples/start_workflow.py
  trainer.evaluate_encoder(split="test", plot=True, plot_kwargs=dict(show=False, output="docs/img/start_workflow_encoder_analysis_split_test.png"))
-->

The decoder evaluation evaluates how the base model can be changed by applying a learnt GRADIEND decoder update under a Language Modeling Score (LMS) constraint (i.e., changing the feature behavior while not *destroying* other capabilities). By default only the **strengthen** direction is evaluated; use **increase_target_probabilities=False** to evaluate **weaken** only (result keys then use the `_weaken` suffix, e.g. `dec["3SG_weaken"]`). Only the dataset–feature-factor combinations required for the chosen direction are computed.
```python
dec = trainer.evaluate_decoder(plot=True, target_class="3SG")  
changed_base_model = trainer.rewrite_base_model(decoder_results=dec, target_class="3SG")
```

The `changed_base_model` is expected to be biased towards singular (i.e., **strengthened** for the target class 3SG). To evaluate only one target class (e.g. for efficiency), use `evaluate_decoder(plot=True, target_class="3SG")`.

## What else you can build from here

The example above keeps things intentionally simple: one feature (3SG vs 3PL), two classes, and a small artificial corpus. Once that works, you can extend it in several directions:

- **Add more feature classes**: extend `feature_targets` with more [`TextFilterConfig`][gradiend.data.text.filter_config.TextFilterConfig]s (e.g. 1SG, 1PL, 2SGPL, 3SG, 3PL for pronouns) and regenerate data via [`TextPredictionDataCreator`][gradiend.data.text.prediction.creator.TextPredictionDataCreator] (recommended to use `spacy_tags={"pos": "PRON"}` and `spacy_model="en_core_web_sm"` to reduce data noise). You can then train multiple GRADIENDs (different `target_classes` / `run_id`s) and compare them using the [top‑k overlap heatmap](tutorials/evaluation-inter-model.md) ([`plot_topk_overlap_heatmap`][gradiend.visualizer.topk.pairwise_heatmap.plot_topk_overlap_heatmap]), as demonstrated in the detailed examples.

- **Merge fine‑grained classes into higher‑level features**: when your data has more than two base classes (e.g. 1SG, 1PL, 3SG, 3PL), you can learn higher‑level features by merging:

  - **Number**: `class_merge_map={"singular": ["1SG", "3SG"], "plural": ["1PL", "3PL"]}`
  - **Person**: e.g., 1 vs 2 `class_merge_map={"1st": ["1SG", "1PL"], "2nd": ["2SGPL"]}`

  With exactly two merged classes, `target_classes` is inferred automatically. See [train_english_pronouns.py](https://github.com/aieng-lab/gradiend/blob/main/gradiend/examples/train_english_pronouns.py) or the step-by-step [train_english_pronouns.ipynb](https://github.com/aieng-lab/gradiend/blob/main/gradiend/examples/train_english_pronouns.ipynb) notebook (published HF data → training 3SG vs 3PL → evaluation).

- **Control which base‑class transitions are created**: for more fine‑grained setups you can explicitly restrict which raw feature pairs are used before merging by passing `class_merge_transition_groups` alongside `class_merge_map`. For example, given raw classes `["1SG","1PL","3SG","3PL"]`, you can separate clusters by person

  ```python
  class_merge_map = {"SG": ["1SG", "3SG"], "PL": ["1PL", "3PL"]}
  class_merge_transition_groups = [["1SG", "1PL"], ["3SG", "3PL"]]
  ```

  This keeps only transitions **within** each cluster (1SG↔1PL and 3SG↔3PL) and drops cross‑cluster ones (e.g. 1SG→3PL), which can be important for convergence in some use cases.

## What you just did

- Used **[`TextPredictionDataCreator`][gradiend.data.text.prediction.creator.TextPredictionDataCreator]** to build per-class textual training data (3SG: he/she vs 3PL: they) to extract a user-defined feature by feature-related-gradients.
- Trained a GRADIEND model on gradient differences between the two classes defined by the data.
- Ran **encoder evaluation** (correlation, plots) and **decoder evaluation** (probability shifts).
- Called **rewrite_base_model** to obtain a rewritten model in memory (best parameters for chosen **target_class**; by default **strengthens** that class).
