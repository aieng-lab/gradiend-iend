# Tutorial: Evaluation (intra-model)

This tutorial covers **intra-model** evaluation: encoder and decoder evaluation for a **single** trained GRADIEND model, i.e., evaluating whether the encoder separates feature classes and whether the decoder can shift the base model’s behavior under language-model constraints.

To run code yourself, you should have a trained GRADIEND model (e.g. after [Tutorial: Training](training.md)). 
For **comparing multiple runs** (top-k overlap, heatmaps), see [Tutorial: Evaluation (inter-model)](evaluation-inter-model.md).

!!! tip "Optional dependency: plotting"
    Encoder distribution plots and decoder evaluation plots in this tutorial require the **plot** extra. If you did not install it with GRADIEND, install it with:

    ```bash
    pip install gradiend[plot]
    ```

## Encoder Evaluation

### What encoder evaluation does

**Encoder evaluation** answers the questions: *Do the encoded gradients separate the feature classes? And how are non-target but related gradients encoded?* 

The trainer runs your evaluation data (and optionally neutral data) through the GRADIEND encoder and computes a **correlation** between the encoded values and the class labels. High correlation means the encoder has learned to distinguish the two classes (e.g. masc_nom vs fem_nom) from their gradients.

**evaluate_encoder(...)** runs the full pipeline: encode the data, compute unified encoder metrics, and optionally produce a distribution plot. It returns a dict with all metrics (see below). Use `return_df=True` to include the full `encoder_df` key.

```python
enc_eval = trainer.evaluate_encoder(max_size=100, split='test', return_df=True, plot=True)
```

[:material-file-code-outline: `start_workflow.py`](https://github.com/aieng-lab/gradiend/blob/main/gradiend/examples/start_workflow.py)

Options:

- **max_size**: Maximum number of examples to encode per *input class* (for speed; set to `None` for all). Input classes are defined by feature class ids (i.e., per training transition) and each neutral dataset is a input class. 
- **split**: Which split to evaluate on (e.g. `test`, `val`).
- **return_df**: Whether to include the full DataFrame of encoded values and metadata in the returned dict (can be large).
- **plot**: Whether to create a distribution plot of encoded values by class (see below).
- **plot_kwargs**: Optional dict of kwargs to customize the plot (e.g. `legend_name_mapping` to make class labels human-readable).
- **use_cache**: Whether to load from cache if available (skips re-encoding).
- ... (much more options; see API reference for details).

Crucially, this method computes cache files depending on `max_size` and `split` such that you can later easily compare different encodings on different splits and sizes without re-running the encoding analysis.

### Encoder Datasets

We consider different types of datasets/ gradient as GRADIEND encoder inputs:

- **training**: data as seen during training (i.e., the target class transitions and optionally identity transitions for other classes).
- **neutral_training_masked**: an automated approach to derive a neutral-like dataset for training-like data, by first creating un-masked texts (replace [MASK] by the factual label), and then only use non-feature related target tokens to derive *neutral* gradients (see )
- **neutral_dataset**: a separate dataset of neutral examples that are not seen during training. Pass this dataset as `eval_neutral_dataset` to the trainer.

### Encoder Distribution Plot

An easy overview of the encoder’s behavior is the **distribution plot**: a violin plot showing how the encoded values distribute for 

*Run encoder evaluation with `plot=True` (or [`trainer.plot_encoder_distributions()`][gradiend.trainer.trainer.Trainer.plot_encoder_distributions]) to generate the distribution plot.*

We expect that the target training classes encode to polarly different values  (+-1), while the neutral variants (if present) should cluster around 0.
To visually highlight the special role of target classes, we mark their violins and legend entries in **bold**.

This plot has a lot of options to customize, e.g., to make the class labels human-readable (e.g. `masc_nom` → “masc nominative”) or to group classes into broader categories (e.g. all neutral variants into “neutral”). By default the plot shows only the target (training) transition(s) and neutral data; use `plot_kwargs=dict(target_and_neutral_only=False)` with [`evaluate_encoder(plot=True)`][gradiend.trainer.trainer.Trainer.evaluate_encoder] to show all transitions. See [Evaluation & visualization](../guides/evaluation-visualization.md#encoder-distributions) for full customization options.

### Encoder Metrics 

Another option to interpret the encoder’s behavior is the returned dict of metrics (i.e., quantified properties). The exact keys depend on the options you pass to [`evaluate_encoder()`][gradiend.trainer.trainer.Trainer.evaluate_encoder], but here is a general overview of the main keys and their interpretation:

| Key | Type | Interpretation                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `n_samples` | int | Total number of encoded examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `sample_counts` | dict | Breakdown by `by_type` (training, neutral_training_masked, neutral_dataset) and optionally `training_by_feature_class`.                                                                                                             |
| `all_data` | dict | Metrics over **all** rows. Contains `correlation` (Pearson) and `accuracy` (ternary classification using neg/pos boundaries).                                                                                                       |
| `training_only` | dict | Same keys as `all_data`, but computed only over **training** rows (excludes type neutral; compared to `target_classes_only` this may include identity transitions if enabled with label 0). Uses ternary classification (-1, 0, 1). |
| `target_classes_only` | dict | Same keys, but over target class transitions only (excludes type neutral and identity, label 0). Uses **binary** classification (pred ≥ neutral_boundary → 1, else -1).                                                             |
| `boundaries` | dict | Thresholds used for accuracy computation: `neg_boundary`, `pos_boundary`, `neutral_boundary` (configurable via parameters in [`evaluate_encoder()`][gradiend.trainer.trainer.Trainer.evaluate_encoder]).                                                                                 |
| `correlation` | float | Pearson correlation of training_only (typically used as main training score). |
| `mean_by_class` | dict | Label value (−1, 0, 1) → mean encoded value. Uses **non-neutral-type rows only** (training + identity). For class separation on target/identity transitions. |
| `mean_by_type` | dict | Type (`training`, `neutral_training_masked`, `neutral_dataset`) → mean encoded value. Covers **all** rows including neutral variants; use for final eval when neutral means matter. |
| `neutral_mean_by_type` | dict | Subset of `mean_by_type` for neutral variants only (`neutral_training_masked`, `neutral_dataset`). Convenience for comparing encoder behavior on neutral data. |
| `mean_by_feature_class` | dict | Feature class id (e.g. source_id) → mean encoded value. When present. |
| `label_value_to_class_name` | dict | Label value → human-readable class name: **0 → "neutral"**; other labels → `source_id` when available (e.g. `1 → "masc_nom"`, `-1 → "fem_nom"`). |
| `encoder_df` | DataFrame | Included only when [`evaluate_encoder(return_df=True)`][gradiend.trainer.trainer.Trainer.evaluate_encoder]. Full per-row data (encoded, label, type, source_id, target_id).                                                                                                              |

### Running encoder evaluation and plots

Typical usage after training:

```python
# Full run: encode, correlate, optionally get DataFrame and plot
enc_eval = trainer.evaluate_encoder(max_size=1000, return_df=True, plot=True)
print("Correlation:", enc_eval.get("correlation"))

# Later: reuse from cache (no re-encoding)
# Importantly: you must provide same max_size and split to load the same cache file (or omit these both times to use defaults)
enc_eval = trainer.evaluate_encoder(max_size=1000, use_cache=True)
```

## Decoder Evaluation

### What decoder evaluation does

**Decoder evaluation** answers: *Can we change the base model’s behavior by applying the learned decoder (before negatively affecting general language modeling capabilities)?* 
It tries different positive **learning rates** and **feature factors** (usually -1 and +1) using the update formula "base model + learning rate * decoder(feature factor)", and aims to select the *best* option at the end.

Each run measures how much the model’s predictions shift (i.e. probability of target tokens and impact on language modeling performance). 
The result is a grid of scores; the “best” configuration is the one that maximizes a chosen metric (e.g. probability shift toward the target class while satisfying a language-model constraint), see *policies* below.

**evaluate_decoder()** runs this grid (or loads it from cache when **use_cache=True**). It returns a dict with summary entries at top level (e.g. `dec['3SG']` for strengthen, `dec['3SG_weaken']` for weaken), plus `grid` and optional `plot_paths`/`plot_path`. By default only the **strengthen** direction is computed; pass **increase_target_probabilities=False** to compute only **weaken** (summary keys then use the `_weaken` suffix). Only the dataset–feature-factor combinations required for the chosen direction are evaluated.

Like encoder evaluation, decoder evaluation accepts `split` and `max_size`.
`split` selects the training-like rows used for probability scoring, and
`max_size` is a shared cap for both training-like rows and neutral LMS rows. Use
`max_size_training_like` and `max_size_neutral` when the two caps should differ.

**Decoder eval targets** (which tokens to score per class) are inferred from your data when `decoder_eval_targets` is omitted, or set explicitly. When the same token appears in multiple classes with different meanings (e.g. commutative vs non-commutative formulas), use an instance-dependent mapping. See [Decoder eval targets](../guides/decoder-eval-targets.md) for class-based, label-based, and (label, label_class) options and the commutative example.

---

### Neutral data for decoder evaluation (LMS)

Decoder evaluation needs two kinds of data: **training-like** (for probability scoring) and **neutral** (for LMS, i.e. language modeling score). The neutral data should ideally be feature-independent (no target tokens), so LMS reflects general language quality.

**`eval_neutral_data` is optional.** When you omit it (or pass `None`):

- **Fallback:** The trainer uses the **training-like data** (test split) as neutral data. Each row's `text` column is built by filling the mask with the **factual token**.
- **LMS behavior:** Because these texts contain target tokens, the trainer automatically adds all target tokens to `decoder_eval_ignore_tokens`, so they are ignored when computing perplexity. This avoids distorting LMS by feature-related predictions.

For best practice, provide true neutral data (e.g. via [`TextPredictionDataCreator`][gradiend.data.text.prediction.creator.TextPredictionDataCreator].generate_neutral_data() or a HuggingFace dataset like `aieng-lab/wortschatz-leipzig-de-grammar-neutral`) when available. The fallback is suitable for quick runs or when neutral data is not available.

### Next step: model rewrite

Decoder evaluation selects candidate rewrite settings (learning rate / feature factor) per target class and direction.  
Applying and saving rewritten checkpoints is covered in [Tutorial: Model Rewrite](model-rewrite.md).

---

### Policies for selecting the best config

The “best” config is the one that optimizes a chosen metric, which is defined by `SelectionPolicy`:

- **`LMSThresholdPolicy`**: Restrict to candidates whose LMS is at least `ratio` × base LMS (default `ratio=0.99`), then pick the one that maximizes the metric. If none pass the threshold, fall back to the candidate with smallest learning rate (least decoder impact).
- **`LMSTimesMetricPolicy`**: Pick the candidate that maximizes `metric × lms` (product of metric and LMS). Balances probability shift with language modeling preservation in one score.

### Minimal intra-model evaluation snippet

```python
# After trainer.train() and trainer.plot_training_convergence()
enc_eval = trainer.evaluate_encoder(max_size=100, return_df=True, plot=True)
# Reuse from cache when re-running:
# enc_eval = trainer.evaluate_encoder(use_cache=True)

dec_results = trainer.evaluate_decoder()
# Optional: dec_results = trainer.evaluate_decoder(split="test", max_size=100, use_cache=True) when re-running

# Next step:
# changed_model = trainer.rewrite_base_model(decoder_results=dec_results, target_class="masc_nom")
# See Tutorial: Model Rewrite for strengthen/weaken and saving behavior.
