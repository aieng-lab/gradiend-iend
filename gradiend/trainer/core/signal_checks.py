"""
Cheap sanity checks on the training signal.

A mis-built training item (e.g. the supervised label placed on a padding token) does not raise:
the loss stays finite and every input of a class becomes bit-identical, so the encoder "converges"
by memorising one vector per class. These checks turn that failure into an immediate error.

* :class:`SignalDiversityCallback` reads the within-class spread of the encoded values that every
  evaluation already computes (``std_by_class``). It adds no forward or backward pass and no memory,
  and judges the first evaluation, before training has changed anything: with a diverse signal the
  freshly initialised encoder already spreads the examples of a class, with identical inputs it
  cannot.
* :func:`assert_signal_diverse` is the same test on an explicit matrix of inputs, for callers that
  already hold stacked training examples.
